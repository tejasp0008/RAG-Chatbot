# RAG Chatbot with Langchain and HuggingFace ðŸ¦œðŸ”—ðŸ¤—

## Developed by Tejas Pal

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot using Langchain ðŸ¦œðŸ”— and HuggingFace ðŸ¤—

## Overview

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances response generation by combining pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with custom data. This approach integrates dense retrieval models with sequence-to-sequence transformers, ensuring that generated responses are both contextually relevant and knowledge-rich. The RAG model first retrieves relevant documents, processes them through an LLM, and then generates informed responses by combining both pre-trained knowledge and custom data insights.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

Set up your virtual environment:

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Create a `.env` file and add your Hugging Face API key:

```bash
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_key
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application

Start the chatbot application:

```bash
gradio app.py
```

This will launch the web-based chatbot interface, allowing real-time interaction with the RAG model.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the chatbot through the web interface, where it will generate responses based on both pre-trained knowledge and retrieved documents.
